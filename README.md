# Malevolent-Shrine
#### Video Demo:
#### Description:
A 2D Zelda-like RPG that will challenge the player and provide an enjoyable albeit unforgiving experience. I created this game using the Unity game engine, and along the way I learnt the C# programming language. Unity has exhaustive resources on 2D game development, and its documentation along with YouTube tutorials were the main resources used 
to effectively complete my game. The main aim of the game is to reach Malevolent Shrine, providing a rich exploration and combat experience which may be unforgiving to some. The game is available to play on both Windows and Mac.
